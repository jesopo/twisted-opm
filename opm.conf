# Pools used to limit the number of scans running in parallel. Each
# scan defined later takes a token from the pool when it starts and
# hands it back when it stops. If the pool runs out of tokens further
# scans start getting queued. Normally pool numbers correspond roughly
# to file descriptor usage.
#
# You can use any number of pools. The "dns" pool is special: it is used
# internally by dns lookups done by the scanner. In normal usage these
# lookups are rare. You can use the "dns" pool with normal scanners too.
#
# Running scans against common ports with a short timeout against a
# different pool than longer-running less common ones is supposed to
# help when the scanner is overloaded.
